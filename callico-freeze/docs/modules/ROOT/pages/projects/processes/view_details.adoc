= View a process details

[WARNING]
====
You must be a manager of the project to view the details of a specific process.

If you are a member with manager role, the `View details` button is displayed next to each process on the process list.

Project managers can view details of a process linked to a project through its details page, where you can see:

* its name,
* its mode,
* the user who created it,
* its status,
* when it started, if it has started,
* when it ended, if it has ended,
* its logs, which are useful to debug any issue and summarize what happened during its execution.

In addition, if a process has just been created or is currently running, a `Stop` button is displayed next to its status, allowing you to terminate its execution.

Please note, however, that stopping a process will not cancel any actions that have already been performed by that process.

For example, if you stop an import process after it has already imported 3 *folder* elements out of 10, these 3 folders will not be deleted from your project.
