[#manage-members-in-a-project]
= Manage members in a project

[WARNING]
====
You must be a manager of the project to manage its members.
====

If you are a member with manager role, the `Manage members` action is displayed in the section named *Project* from the menu on the left of the project details page.

From this page, you can add or remove members, as well as update their role manually. If you want to add many users or people who do not yet have a Callico account as contributors, you can use the project invitation link. For more information, please see the xref:./invite_users.adoc[dedicated page].

Members in a project can have three different roles:

* *Contributors* annotate the documents,
* *Moderators* validate or invalidate the collected annotations,
* *Managers* manage the project by creating and coordinating campaigns and tasks.

[NOTE]
====

* If a user with the contributor role is removed from the project, or promoted to another role within the project, then all their draft and pending tasks will be automatically deleted. Their completed tasks will be preserved.
* If a user with the manager role is removed from the project, or demoted to another role within the project, then all their xref:tasks/create.adoc#preview-a-single-task[preview tasks] will be automatically deleted.
* For security reasons, you are not allowed to update or delete your own membership.
