[#discuss-tasks]
= Discuss tasks

[WARNING]
====

* To discuss a task, you must either be assigned to it or be a moderator or manager of the project.
* You cannot discuss tasks in a campaign if that campaign is in a xref:campaigns/close_reopen_archive.adoc[`Closed` or `Archived` state].
====

If you are a contributor assigned to the task, a moderator or a manager member, the `comments` icon button is displayed, in the upper right corner in various locations such as:

* the task annotation page,
* the xref:./moderate.adoc[task moderation page],
* the task details page.

For managers and moderators, you can also find a link to access the task discussion on the xref:./list.adoc#moderators-managers[task list page].

When annotating, moderating or even simply viewing a task, some questions and remarks may arise. The task discussion page is useful to communicate between contributors, moderators and managers and *closely collaborate on your documents*.

One can use the dedicated input indicated by the `+Type your comment here...+` placeholder and the `Comment` button to start or participate in the task discussion.

This is the right place to:

* report any problem occurring during the annotation,
* ask questions to power users about the campaign instructions,
* provide feedback to contributors during the moderation phase,
* etc.

[NOTE]
====

* Participants will automatically receive an email to inform them of a new comment in a discussion they are part of.
* If the commenting user is a contributor, all project managers, even the ones which are not part of the discussion, will also receive an email.
