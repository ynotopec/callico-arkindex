To create a campaign, you need to provide a name and select one of the available xref:./index.adoc[campaign modes]. You can also provide an optional description. This name and description will be displayed to all the users that have access to your campaign's project: you can use the description to explain the purpose of this annotation campaign, and/or to give contributors annotation instructions.
