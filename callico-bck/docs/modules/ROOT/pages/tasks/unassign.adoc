= Unassign tasks

[WARNING]
====

* You must be a manager of the project to unassign tasks.
* Tasks cannot be unassigned if the campaign is in the `Archived` state.
====

If some tasks are unsuitable, or for example one of the contributors is not available, you can unassign tasks. You can only unassign tasks in a `Draft` or `Pending` state. It is not possible to unassign tasks that have already been worked on.

From this page, you can also quickly delete all unassigned tasks that are available on your campaign.
