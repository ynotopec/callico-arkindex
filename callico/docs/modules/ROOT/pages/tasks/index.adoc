= Tasks

To annotate elements in Callico, you must create annotation tasks. Each task concerns *a single xref:projects/elements/index.adoc[element]* of a certain type, which is selected when creating those tasks. Depending on the mode of the xref:campaigns/index.adoc[campaign] and its configuration, contributors may be able to annotate multiple items on one element.

To create tasks, refer to the xref:./create.adoc[task creation documentation].
