== Moderators & Managers

Project moderators and managers can see all the tasks that exist in a campaign.

For each task, it is possible to see:

* the element it concerns,
* its creation date,
* its number of comments,
* the user it is assigned to,
* a preview of the task if it is a preview task xref:./create.adoc#preview-a-single-task[created by the form], using the `Preview task` button,
* its status,
* the uncertain state with a small yellow exclamation mark, if a user has marked at least one value on their task as uncertain,
* the annotations that have been made, using the `View details` button.

The results can be filtered according to:

* the task status,
* the feedback provided by the contributors (with comments, uncertain, both, etc),
* the assigned user.
