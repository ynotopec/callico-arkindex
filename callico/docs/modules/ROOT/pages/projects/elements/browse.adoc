Once elements are imported from xref:./import/arkindex.adoc[Arkindex] the application offers a minimal navigation among them.

While browsing *folder* elements, you can:

* access their children,
* list their associated tasks.

* list their associated tasks.

[NOTE]
====

* Elements which refer to an image sub-part (e.g. a *single line* on a *page*) are not visible or browsable from this interface.
* If you try to access a contributor's annotation task (from a link), you will be redirected to the element details page.
