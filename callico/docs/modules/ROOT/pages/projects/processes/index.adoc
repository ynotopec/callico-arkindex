= Processes

In Callico, processes are tasks that can take several seconds, minutes or even hours to complete. To avoid paralysing users for long periods of time, they are *asynchronous* and can be executed in parallel with each other, at the same time as users use the web interface.

Such processes are mainly used when importing data and elements from third-parties but also when exporting annotation results.
