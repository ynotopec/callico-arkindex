[#configure-a-classification-campaign]
= Configure a *Classification* campaign

You can create a *Classification* campaign in order to classify documents or elements on these documents.

[WARNING]
====
You can only create *Classification* campaigns on projects that have classes. Whether or not a project has classes depends on the information retrieved from the project's provider which can be set when xref:projects/create.adoc[creating a project] or later from its xref:projects/edit.adoc[edition] page.
====

[#configuration-parameters]
== Configuration parameters

After having filled out the xref:./index.adoc[generic configuration parameters], including the optional xref:./index.adoc#context-ancestor-type[*Context ancestor type*] parameter, you need to select the classes that will be available to annotate items in your campaign.

image::campaigns/configure/classification/available_classes.png[Available classes]

Available classes are retrieved from the object your Callico project is linked to on its xref:projects/edit.adoc[external provider]. If your campaign's Callico project is linked to an Arkindex project, the classes to select from are all the classes available on that Arkindex project.

[#example-annotation-task]
== Example annotation task

When contributors annotate a task, the selected classes are displayed in alphabetical order.

[NOTE]
.Keyboard shortcuts
====
In the screenshot above, the numbers next to the classes correspond to keyboard shortcuts the contributor can use to annotate. For example, to annotate the displayed text line as a `Row`, the contributor can hit the `3` key instead of clicking on the class name.
====

Once your campaign is configured, you can xref:tasks/create.adoc[create tasks] to start gathering annotations on your documents.
